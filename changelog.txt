1.6
	Changed the filehandling. Select the main folder of your bot instead of a file.
	The patcher will go through all files and subfolders of the bot.
	It will ignore subsubfolders and other folders nested deeper than that.
	It will now automagically copy the included header file into the bot folder.

1.3-1.5
	typos, several new headers and functions

1.2
	Found another header for setting attributes, which is used by LoadTemplate.
	All calls to that function made the client crash.
	Added that line to be handled by the patcher.
	Added set_attribute header to GWA2_Headers.au3
	Added upgrade_equipment headers to GWA2_Headers.au3
	Added upgrade_equipment function detection to to GWA2_Function_Header_Table.au3

1.1
	It now catches another kind of error that Ive never encountered so far, but better safe than sorry.
	Also improved error logs now.
	Forgot to automagically remove the +1 from some of the gwa2 files sendpacket function.
	added #include-once, as the detection of whether the header file has to be included or not was too optimistic.
